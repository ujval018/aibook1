Here are the top predictions, grouped by theme, with justifications grounded in observed frequency and clustering:

---

### üîß *Heuristic Search, Pathfinding & State Spaces*
1. *"Follow the graph where edge weights show step costs and nodes show heuristic values. Find the most cost-effective path from start to goal using appropriate algorithms."*  
   Justification: Very frequent structure in state space search problems (Topic 7 ‚Äî search, state, follow)

2. *"Explain Alpha-Beta pruning. Define alpha and beta, and solve an example. Also solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle like SEND+MORE=MONEY."*  
   Justification: Popular pairing of game trees and CSPs (Topic 7)

3. *"Solve the 8-puzzle problem from a given initial state to goal using Manhattan heuristic."*  
   Justification: Classic problem repeatedly phrased in different exams (Topic 7)

4. *"Give PDDL descriptions for planning problems such as air cargo or block stacking."*  
   Justification: Emerging trend in AI planning problems (Topic 7)

### ü§ñ *Agents, Architectures, and Learning*
5. *"What is a learning agent? Draw and explain the conceptual diagram. Compare with goal-based and utility-based agents."*  
   Justification: Reappears across agent-related clusters (Topic 4)

6. *"List six capabilities a system must have to pass the Turing Test. Mention limitations."*  
   Justification: Frequently repeated in exams as a concept + discussion (Topic 4)

7. *"Explain how a reflex agent works. Describe it using a decision rule or state table."*  
   Justification: Found with slight variations in multiple papers (Topic 4)

### üß† *Environments & PEA Framework*
8. *"Define the task environment and provide PEA descriptions for an autonomous taxi driver or medical diagnosis system."*  
   Justification: Common across all years (Topic 2 ‚Äî environment, properties, follow)

9. *"Compare BFS and Bidirectional Search in terms of time and space complexity."*  
   Justification: Breadth-first vs. bi-directional is a classic pair (Topic 2)

10. *"Explain performance measures, actuators, and sensors for an intelligent agent in a tabular format."*  
    Justification: This question is asked across various domains ‚Äî medical, vacuum, Mars rover.

### üîç *Logic, FOL & Knowledge Representation*
11. *"Differentiate propositional logic and FOL. Explain universal/existential quantification using De Morgan‚Äôs law."*  
    Justification: FOL transformations and quantifiers are evergreen (Topic 3)

12. *"Write BFS algorithm and apply it on a graph. Solve a water jug problem using state space representation."*  
    Justification: BFS + water jug appears in multiple combinations (Topic 3)

13. *"Explain what a rational agent is. What do you understand by a state, state space, and heuristic function?"*  
    Justification: Often asked as a part of Section A conceptuals (Topic 3)
